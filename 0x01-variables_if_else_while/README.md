What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them 
# They are mathimatical symbols implying a certain function to be executed (e.g + add , - subtract, * multiply, / divide, % modulo(integer remainder)). 
# ++var (increment) before functions or loops begin & var++ (increments) after execution or loop
# --var (decrement) before function or loops begin & var-- (decrements) after execution or loop

What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
# They evaluate an expression, determine if it is TRUE or FALSE
# || is OR - if one expression is true, then the whole expression is TRUE
# && is AND - if one expression is false, then whole expression FALSE
# ! is NOT - if the expression is false, the whole expression is TRUE and vice-versa

What the the relational operators and how to use them
# Are us to compare two operators in a expression. 
# > (greater), < (less than), == (equal), >= (greater or equal to), <= (less than or equal to), # != (not equal to) 

What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
#For interpretation, Zero is interpreted as false and anything non-zero is interpreted as true.
